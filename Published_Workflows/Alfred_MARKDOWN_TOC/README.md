# Alfred Workflow to create Table Of Contents

I was inspired by a github project [github-markdown-toc](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc) and decided to 
create an Alfred workflow to get the table of contents from the selected text in any markdown file.

# Usage
> 1. Copy the markdown text
> 2. Go to the begin of the file.
> 3. Type "toc" it will create the table of contents in the background.
> 4. Paste
